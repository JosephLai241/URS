            "selftext": "I joined a company a few months ago as a remote dev. This is what has transpired since then:\n\n- No onboarding, I was working on code a few hours into my shift before even being introduced to everyone. Wasn't even signed up for health insurance but they were still like \"MUSH!\"\n- CEO is an asshole. Yells at people in meetings. Openly hated by employees.\n- No culture. People don't talk to each other at all. Everyone is cold and unfriendly.\n- Mass attrition. The engineering department has lost 1/3rd of existing employees this year. They have responded by doing mass hiring but even those new people are noping out after they found out what a nightmare this place is.\n- Bait and switch job. I am not doing what I interviewed for.... at ALL\n- I was supposed to get RSU's but mysteriously all talks of that are gone. So I'm literally missing compensation.\n- They have been throwing around the idea of moving all employees (even remote) to in office across the country next year which I won't do. So I might not even have a job come 2022.\n\nSo needless to say this place fucking sucks. But instead of stressing myself out and cranking up my anxiety, I have taken a different approach: I have not been taking this job seriously at all. \n\nI get up and sign on to Slack on my phone and not leave bed until an hour or more later. I never work past 5 despite others working long hours. I might do 2 hours of actual work a day. I'll get up in the middle of the work day and and disappear for awhile. \n\nI mean why the fuck should I care? This place has shit all over me, and I don't care if I do the same. If I get fired I'll just tell the next job I was let go because I didn't want to move across the country (which is already all over Glassdoor). If I'm not let go I plan on doing this until late this year and then I'll start leetcoding again. \n\nSo my question is, has anyone ever done this before? What was the overall impact to your career to just dick around for awhile at a place you hate before moving on somewhere else?",

            "selftext": "About 2 years ago I decided to teach myself React.js and I sat down with a you tube tutorial into the syntax and how to write JS. Then once that had finished I was wondering what to do now? Like so many people who get to this stage and decide I have not really learned much and not really getting this, so I will give up. I think this is where a lot of self-taught devs drop off. You learn all the syntax and how to debug a syntax error and not really how to create something.   \n\n\nSo I decided to go to uDemy and learn how to make a [slack clone](https://slackclone-5f7d8.firebaseapp.com/).  That taught me so much about debugging, flex boxes and frustration. I built it and was proud of it. Now what next I am not job ready so let me try and build something else...   \n\n\nI decided to try my hand at React Native this was just before covid hit and I was furloughed from a job I hated. Which I was ecstatic about because it gave me time to code and cycle. I continued trying to make an app for my cricket club, which never materialised unfortunately. I continued playing around with RN and building silly apps that never got anywhere but I learned so much.   \n\n\nThen in December a recruiter had seen my Linkedin profile and decided to give me a call about a contract job, and said that they were keen to hire ASAP and I should have an interview the next day. He also told me the name of the company. He requested my CV and I sent it over with a link to various projects and my Github. Then I never heard back from him. I was ghosted by him.   \n\n\nI found the CEO on Linkedin and sent her a message with my CV and GitHub link and my story and being upfront and honest about this being my first job and I am keen to learn. I had a call with the CEO and the CTO that same day and got the job. I have been working at the company since January and I have been learning so much and improving each day. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo for any devs trying to get a job:   \n\\- Don't give up  \n\\- Be relentless  \n\\- Always learn   \n\\- Publish your code on social media  \n\\- Write medium about what you are building  \n\n\nGood luck you can do it.   \nPS I am 36",

It was pretty stressful because the client had dealt with poor hiring choices by my employer.\n\nThe person hired and then fired before I came along wasn't very good, and pushed some of the worst code I had ever seen. Paired with the other dev (my current colleague), they didn't use any testing or version control. App folders were everywhere, and it was just a general mess.\n\nDespite the awful practices I was getting hours to fix their codebase and contribute ideas based on my academic experience, but the client was spending money elsewhere and said he could only afford 1 programmer at a time after 10 months of me working there.\n\nSo a lot of tasks I should've done such as API and mobile app pair was split between me and another dev. The client didn't want to pay me to help the other dev design the API even though the other dev pushed a lot of buggy/badly designed code, which always stretched out the time I worked on the app, which meant I was often waiting for fixes to the API and maybe doing a few Wordpress updates in the meantime. Even recently, I called out a design flaw in the API, and the client's response now was to rewrite it as I would've done it, but have the other dev program it. So obviously going in circles.\n\nLast week, I found a job paying 2x what I was paid last year and put in 4 weeks notice (4 weeks is normal in New Zealand).\n\nMy employer let his largest client know today and in response there was just silence. I don't feel bad at all, because I've been covering rent with savings for the past few months because as an hourly dev, he's pushed my tasks later and later in the year while the other developer worked full time fixing bugs (his coding skills were improving but still green and without tests.. bugs always appeared in production because the client didn't want him to take the time to learn xdebug). My direct employer is cool, but he felt threatened that the client could yank the project at any time, killing his software house.\n\nI imagine the next weeks are going to be hell with the client because he's used to firing people, not having people leave since people often come to him desperate for work. He's abused my employer and my colleague multiple times for their religion because they take breaks to pray. I'm not religious, but I still don't think it's right to shame employees for taking a religious day off or going to prayer in the afternoon.\n\nAnd being that I was the only dev who wrote an entire mobile app and knows Java, his app will be paused until they can find another dev who's willing to work part-time. The worry is that they will get another developer like my predecessor who has no experience and is unwilling to learn. He's likely going to push me to do documentation on everything, which I would've done earlier but he didn't want to pay me to do on his tight deadline.\n\nHow should I approach this if the client gets abusive.. Just leave?",

From the beginning of working there, I have communicated to them that one day I would do that. I told my boss 6 weeks ago (about 4 months before leaving and 2 months before being obliged to tell him) that I was planning to start the degree this year, but said I was interested in continuing to work there part-time. Back then he said that it was quite a short time to find someone else, but accepted it.\n\nHe didn't get back to me for 5 weeks (and apparently didn't do anything about it during that time), so it was me who asked for a meeting about 1 week ago to discuss the details of the part-time engagement. Turns out we had very different expectations of how much work I was going to do - I was planning to focus on the degree and thus only work there for 8h/week (at least for a couple months, and then probably leave once a new opportunity comes along), he was expecting 20h/week + more outside the lecture periods. I told him I didn't want to work that much to focus on the degree, he argued that a financing round was planned for this fall and without a \"real\" CTO he had a hard time raising funds, and without funds he had a hard time finding a new CTO and thus had a huge problem. It seemed like he was making me feel as though this was my fault now and giving me a bad conscience about it. This stirred me up a bit and I started to look for alternatives what to do instead working there part-time during my degree (e.g., freelancing). We decided to talk about it again 1 week later.\n\nThinking more about this and finding the alternatives much more attractive and more valuable in terms of my career, I decided I didn't want to work there anymore long-term for different reasons. So I told him today in our meeting that it was my plan to leave the company in 3 months instead of continuing to work there part-time as originally planned. He was staggered and told me he was very disappointed and me not wanting to work there for a couple more weeks/months (part-time) could now cost everyone their job (because of them not getting new funding this way). He made me feel guilty of letting the team down.\n\nWhile I am still sure this is the right decision for me and my career and I don't think I have done anything wrong (feel free to convince me otherwise), I'm still feeling bad about the possibility that me leaving might actually negatively affect the jobs of my team mates (as I have an essential role in the company, both operationally and (apparently) for getting funding).   \n\n\nWould love to hear your thoughts on it!",

            "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI am \"experienced\" software engineer at FANG with 5 yoe. Experienced is in quotes because five years isn't whole lot, but I'm definitely not new grad anymore. I've given dozens of interviews, was a manager for couple of years in my previous company, and met with hundreds of job seekers at career fairs. This subreddit was great when I was looking for new jobs, but it seems now more than ever saturated by either new grads or students, so wanted to give some perspectives on how to get that first job. Everything is my personal opinion, and will be geared towards people looking for entry level swe positions.\n\nSo you've been applying. You've had few bites here and there, but no real offer yet. Some people say job search is numbers game, which is true, to an extent. But if you spend some time introspecting on what you are lacking, then you can hugely improve your odds. There are three main components to job search: your resume, people skill, technical interview skill.\n\nFirst your resume, this is your foundation. If the foundation is solid, it will make your job searching that much easier. You can tell your resume is lacking if your callback rate is low. If your resume isn't the best, then your focus should be improving this. Because it doesn't matter how good of engineer you are or master leetcoder, if you never get an interview in first place to able to show them. Formatting and wording is important, but what I usually look for when looking at resumes of new grads is whether they have internships or significant personal projects. Internship is usually better than personal projects, but if you are having hard time getting internship or it doesn't work with your timeline, then spend couple of months making personal project or, better yet, getting a group of friends to do a project and join hackathons. This not only boosts your resume but also gives you talking points in your interviews. 80 percent of the companies will ask you to tell them about something you built.\n\nNow the personal skills. Or as I would like to call it, do you know how to function in a professional setting. If you pass the resume screening (and online assessments) first step is usually a recruiter call. They are looking for red flags and whether you are really interested in their company. So smile, look engaged, and most importantly sound excited for the opportunity. Do some research about the company beforehand, ask meaningful questions and not something like \"is the lunch free?\"\n\nLastly the technical assessment. This is the most dreaded part for most people. Alas, there isn't a golden bullet here. You just have to grind. Grind leetcode, hit the books, and you will get better eventually. But be sure to leetcode intentionally. Meaning you don't always look at solutions after being stuck couple of minutes. If you had to look at a solution to solve a question, then try redoing it right away or the day after, you will be surprised how many questions you've done before you can't do anymore, this just means you didn't truly master the concept, so take it as sign to study more.\n\nLastly, learn from your failures. Unless you are very lucky or all star new grad from Stanford with 5 internships, you will fail your first interviews. The company will also never tell you what the issue was, so spend time on your own what you think went wrong. Was it technical question? Did you say something wrong? Were you too nervous? Debrief with your friends and mentors. And pat on yourself on the back, because that just means you just got that much better at interviewing.  Think of it as getting exp points in interviewing skills. Also remember that luck plays a huge factor in interviews. So keep trying and don't talk rejections personally. Learn from them and eventually you will have an offer.\n\nHope my perspective will be helpful to at least some of you. Feel free to ask me any questions in the comments. I'll answer all of them.\n\nEdit: If you could do me a favor and ask your question as a top level comment, that would make it easier for me to find you. Thank you.\nEdit2: Adding a couple of caveats here, I'm an American so some suggestions might not be as valid in your home country. Also it's for someone looking for a general SWE engineer role, so for breaking into specific industry like AI, embedded, etc, the process is a bit different.",

            "selftext": "My boyfriend graduated from college in 2018 with a CS degree. Since then, he has been unable to land a CS job. He's not even making it to the interview stage most of the time. I'm not really too sure what other advice to give him. He has applied to all jobs in practically every area of the CS spectrum. From engineering to general IT position, to UI/UX jobs. At this point, it's really starting to feel like a lost cause.\n\nWe talked about him going back to school since he really doesn't even like CS to begin with. He would much rather be in nursing, event planning, or maybe even accounting. Unfortunately, like many people, kinda realized this too late. And going back to school is really expensive, We also discussed maybe doing a coding bootcamp might be helpful.\n\nIMO, I think it's because he really doesn't have much technical experience on his resume. He never did an internship and his other part-time jobs aren't really \"CS\".\n\nAny ideas what to suggest?\n\nHere's a pic of his resume with personal details blurred out:\n\n https://imgur.com/N1t77TH",

            "selftext": "Last year I landed a software developer role while still in school. I was set to graduate about a two months from when I got the job and had previously gunshot out over 200 applications. I started working while I was still wrapping up linear algebra.\n\nOf those applications I got plenty of interviews and even landed interviews at Amazon, Square, and IBM just to name a few. I failed pretty hard at the interviews because I'm trash at Leetcode, but I did keep getting asked how I even landed interviews with them. I attribute a lot of my success to my resume and the format I used, primarily because for every phone screen the recruiter mentioned how much they loved the graphics I included, and how interesting the resume was.\n\nI know 73K is not a lot but its at a startup and the stock options and profit share even it out nicely in my opinion.\n\nAnyway, I just wanted to post some advice on what I did to format my resume and also what a lot of recruiters and friends who did work at FAANG told me to include on my resume.\n\n1. Find a resume template that is engaging, but still clean and readable. A lot of you have resume's that are a hot mess. I saw a post recently where an interviewer talked about how people really put a sentence or two at the bottom of their resume just to say they got interviewed at FAANG, as if thats supposed to sway the interviewer. Some of you don't add margins, headings, etc. If you're entry level, no one really cares about the objective section. Just delete it and use the room to add more about your experience and personal projects.\n2. Use action words and talk about impact. That was a big one for Amazon and Microsoft. They want to know what you did and who you impacted. If you don't have any metrics than discuss who your tech should impact. Add a human element, especially if your tech could help vulnerable communities.\n3. Applicant Tracking System. Run your resume through an ATS parser. You want to make sure your resume is being parsed properly.\n4. Try to add involvement that is not tech related. It really highlights how well rounded a person you are. I have two. One that is tech inspired but not purely tech related and one that is unrelated to tech but shows my interests. We all grind and code, but its interesting to know you don't spend all of your time doing that.\n\nHere is the template I use:\n\nMy resume: [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/entry-level-resume-template-latex/jsmpwkcwyntg](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/entry-level-resume-template-latex/jsmpwkcwyntg)\n\nHere is the standard resume template used in tech:\n\nJake's resume: [https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs)\n\nLet me know if there's anything else I could post that may provide insight into the interview process with some of those companies. Some videos I plan on making detail the organizations and internships for freshman and sophomores that I didn't know about (until it was too late and I was a junior) that I saw got my peers into great companies; and what its really like to be a SDE, including scrum, realistic tasks for juniors, etc; and interviews with my friends who do work anywhere from FAANG to national labs as SDE's and MLEs.\n\nAlso feedback is greatly appreciated (:\n\nJust wanted to give back since this community raised me lol.",

Here has been the insanity that has ensued in that time frame:\n\n- The job title I interviewed for was not the one I received in my offer letter. Thought nothing of it, until I started to find out I would be doing support and not writing code. I spoke to my manager and she said it was 80% support, I might get to code later in the year. They did the same thing to two other new hires, WTF \n\n- Required to watch a recorded zoom call. The call actually got heated between management and employees. The CEO cut off an engineer and said \"LOOK HERE'S THE DEAL\u2026\" This is shown to all new hires lmao\n\n- Was told I got equity day 1 in the interviews as part of my comp. Well to my surprise it's radio silence about equity. I spoke to my manager about this and she said this was \"coming soon\". So what I was told in my interviews about that comp doesn't even exist but is supposed to come later? WTF\n\n- Day 1, four hours into my shift I started doing support. I didn't even have my bank account setup to get paid nor did I know who anyone was. No idea what I was doing and I just fumbled through it. \n\n- Work life balance is trash. There are certain PM's that are on Slack 24 hours, you can contact them any time. Boss seems to do 10-11 hour days on average\n\n- First week and 3 engineers left. Granted I don't know how engineering is laid out, but definitely heard \"we can't do X because we lost a guy\" more than once. Department lead mentioned issues around employee retention in all hands meetings WTF \n\n- Culture is trash. No one talks in slack channels, no fun talk about things outside work, no light hearted convos. Don't know anything about my coworkers, It's just work work work. Some people might prefer that but believe me it's about as welcoming as a morgue slab.\n\nSo naturally after week 1 I saw the writing on the wall (the bait and switch alone had me out the door) and continued interviewing. Well I got an offer and they want me to start in two weeks. \n\nI'm thinking after this fucking madness I will only give them 1 week notice and take the next week off to recharge. Then I will leave it off my resume forever. What do you think? Should I even care about burning that bridge?",

Really just looking for some advice or motivation.\n\nI graduated with a CS degree back in May 2020 during the early stages of the pandemic. I was pretty desperate, so I basically took the first tech job I could get. It was at a large non technical F500 company (retail). I've been here around 9 months, but I feel like things are going pretty bad.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* I spend like 75% of my time at my job doing IT support / help desk type stuff. I really hate this and I find it exhausting. I constantly am working tickets and having to work odd hours. I get pulled into doing stuff at 2:00AM sometimes. This is the worst part of the job because I feel like I am not gaining any transferable experience, and at the same time it leaves me completely exhausted. I can barely even describe what I do it all seems so specific to the company's systems.\n* The projects that I do get assigned to do I think are being done with very bad coding practices. This is my first job so I'm not sure how things are normally done. But my first project I was assigned I worked completely alone. I did all the requirements gathering, coding, testing, etc by myself, and would only get to meet with a senior coworker when I need my code promoted. I would try to reach out but didn't get a ton of assistance from coworkers. I've only been with the company a few months and had code promoted to production without anyone else on the team actually looking at it or reviewing. In hindsight I should have tested stuff much more I'm surprised I didn't break anything. Now, my current project has just been \"pair programming\" with the senior dev. But it's all very advanced stuff and I try to keep up, but it's basically just him coding everything and me watching then I do all the documentation. \n* The only other coding I do is write random PowerShell scripts when asked by my manger. For this, I basically just google every single thing I do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSorry if this was a rant, but I really don't like my job. I want to start looking for a new one, but I just feel very mentally drained. It's hard to work on side projects or leetcode when I'm already working like 60 hours a week. And this job is really the only thing I have to put on my resume but I'm not even sure if I'm learning enough to get another job. I've already been out of school for a year so I can't even apply to most new grad roles it seems. Overall, I just feel very stuck in this job and am pretty exhausted honestly.",

Ended up becoming super depressed and dropped out after getting enough credits to snag an associates degree. I took a few programming courses in college for fun and noticed that I was pretty decent at programming relative to my peers so I decided to give programming a shot after dropping out. I put in a lot of self-study, built out some projects just using the MERN stack, and secured an internship from those projects. I ended up working three different internships before receiving my offer for a software engineering position.\n\nThis may sound kind of stupid, but I was making around ten dollars an hour at most of my internships.  My last internship ran out of funding and couldn't really pay me so I went out on the job search again. Ended up interviewing for a position that required two years of experience as well as a bachelor's degree. I had four interviews with them, absolutely killed the interviews. I could tell they were interested in me and I got along with them really well. One interview was supposed to last an hour but I ended up spending two hours on the zoom call with him talking about tech. The position is fully remote and pays \\~$100k. This feels completely undeserved, I feel like I cheated my way into this or something. Even though there's no evidence for it other than I took a completely different path than most.\n\nWondering if there's anyone who has had similar experiences? What was it like working for that position once you secured that well-paying job? Did you feel like an impostor? Any advice on how to cope with this?

I just needed to get this out, maybe get some peoples opinions again.\n\nso basically here's [part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/hl78y1/best_friend_is_offering_me_a_job_i_know_im/) of this post, don't really need to read it as I'll give the jist of it but it does contain insights as to why I'm not really a good programmer and don't really enjoy this job...\n\nTechnical Manager/Solutions Architect Bestfriend offered to help me out, gave me months to prepare for a software engineering job. Originally he wanted me to get a sort of level 1-2 position. To be completely honest with myself, no amount of preparation was going to get me worthy of a MID to SENIOR position (even if he was able to pull the strings to do so) so I took the lowest one as a junior/associate SE.\n\nI got the job, doesn't pay great but I live alone and so the pay is more than enough for me to survive life and even spend a little on my hobbies. There was a 9 week paid bootcamp, comes with a 2 year bond though (I did not leave this out intentionally in the last thread, because the original plan was for me to take a mid level position which I hesitated), I passed that and was put into an ongoing sprint which is managed by my bestfriend (so basically another charity case by him) with a small team of 5 devs (including me) about 2 months ago.\n\nIt started okay, but the pressure was honestly there, I was completely blind at the start but I understood from most posts here that what I felt was normal, but here's comes the part that I hate. The job environment is tbh very chill, the people are good to me , they help me out but I'm just not really good at this, the previous sprint I did not sleep properly for 3 days just to keep up with the work load, I forgot to eat on most days, I would work for free through the night and weekends just to keep up with the deadlines and I assure you the things I'm working on doesn't even seem hard its just I suck... bad.\n\nI would ask help from my team but unless they spoonfed me, most explanations would go over my head and I always feel embarrassed whenever I force myself to ask them. My bestfriend would help me out on numerous occasions just for me to finish a couple of the work assigned to me and I really feel like he's sick and tired of it.\n\nBasically, I have to endure this for a year and a half more Unless I wanted to go AWOL, which I can't really afford. I keep begging my bestfriend to put me into support work, which is bug fixing but he says I would never grow there but I'm honestly just so tired of not having to sleep or eat just to keep up with these 2 week sprints. I feel like I am not ready for this and It's not like I even feel joy whenever I finish my work. There's absolutely no satisfaction here except for that twice a month paycheck.\n\nI'm really considering just begging people to take me out of the team, It would probably be a horrible idea to go into a division that doesn't offer growth but I just want to survive, I cant keep this up, I am a mess and I am so unhappy. I can endure this and pretend like I'm getting better but I think my team wouldn't appreciate their work getting blocked and looking bad infront of the client every time a sprint ends.\n\nIs this all worth it and I'm just too easy to give up? I don't remember the last time I was able to sleep a full 8 hours tbh.\n\nEdit: clarifications about the bootcamp and the bond that came with it.",

In this time I also took advantage of the free Coursera courses and received 17 certificates! This included an 8 week React Course, which I enjoyed very much. Unfortunately all these efforts dont guarantee work. In this time I put in just under 400 job applications. I had only a handful of replies, and only 4 interviews. I was very surprised by the lack of responses considering I tailored each covered letter to nearly every job and wrote a thoughtful note. I had one offer and then was ghosted by them and tried multiple times to contact. Since January I have stopped looking altogether because I dont want to go down in a spiral of depression with the constant rejection. Instead I've been successfully trading crypto. Its really lifted my spirits and am considering looking for work again. I would like to know though, what are some other jobs I could get that might benefit from web dev experience? Or even just a Bachelor degree! At least $15 an hour would be good, *working from home*. Contract, permanent, temporary, I dont care. I just would like to land something, anything, (except Customer Assistance over the phone) it doesnt have to be related to web dev. \n\nThank you\n\nEdit: I updated my resume as all of you suggested. The alignment and spacing is still something I need to work on. It keeps changing depending on how its opened for some reason, so ignore that for now.

            "selftext": "Hey everyone. I'm a (formerly) lead developer based in the Rust Belt. Have about 12 years experience, skill wise I have had my hands all over the place. My last company went belly up due to the pandemic and earlier this year I started interviewing.\n\nWith remote jobs popping off, a whole new world was opened up for me with job opportunities. I got 5 offers since January. Some gave me close or near my low Rust Belt salary, or the benefits weren't great so I turned them down. Then I got an offer from a mid sized West Coast company (remote).\n\nThe job was for a mid level developer role and their salary was amazing for me, so I took it. But then I took the job and found out that the job itself is way beneath me skills wise.... and I haven't even wrote a single line of code in the 2 months I've been there. So here are my pros and cons:\n\nCons:\n\n- Haven't wrote any code, worried I will stagnate skills wise over time.\n\n- They mislead me, so not exactly hyped about that\n\n- Company is going through a transitionary period, a good number of people have left and been backfilled\n\nPros:\n\n- Pay is WAY more than I can get locally. For reference my friend works in my city as a senior dev and gets $40k less than I do for a tough dev job, while I tweak XML files and other easy stuff. Pay is also more than I got with other remote offers\n\n- Great benefits (unlimited PTO with 20 days minimum encouraged, employee perks, don't have to commute)\n\n- I like my coworkers and they like me\n\n- Low stress. No micromanagement, no one cares what schedule you work, job is a breeze, no panic attacks come deadline time. And best of all, NO DAILY STANDUPS OR SCRUM SHIT!!!\n\nSo I am thinking about just sticking it out for a year. After all the mental stress put on by the pandemic, I feel like I could use a year to work a low stress job and remove myself from the rat race, at least for awhile. However, I am worried that I will stagnate and not interview well in a year. I have no problem getting offers now, and I figure that down the line I can work on my Github and stuff again and get back up to speed.\n\nWhat do you think? Is it worth the risk this far into my career?",

I talked to my manager and she insisted I listen to a counter offer, she threw numbers at me but they didn\u2019t hit at least equal to the other offer, so I declined. She then escalated it to her manager, we talked and while he got closer to what I wanted, it wasn\u2019t enough, so I stood my ground and opted to go to the new company. Then, he escalated things to HIS manager which is basically second to the CEO himself, and his manager finally offered me the same amount from the job offer, so I decided to stay and declined the job offer. \n\n\nFast forward to last week, I get an email from Big A stating that I passed the virtual on-site and they want to hire me. The salary they offered is almost 3 times the one I have right now, which is a lot, and obviously working in big tech will look great on my resume. There\u2019s no way I can decline this, but I feel bad for making my employers scrape the bottom of the barrel to pay me what I thought as deserving, so how do I go about telling them I\u2019ll leave anyway without burning any bridges?",

They weren't looking for a junior developer (and initially turned me down because of that) but my resume got me in the door and my interview secured it. My advice is to know your bottleneck and fix it. If you're dead set on FAANG that might be leetcode but if you want anything else it's probably not that. My interviews had a few leetcode-style questions but nothing above an easy-ish medium, the emphasis is very much on how well you can convey your thoughts and communicate with the interviewer.",

A few years back, I went back to school for a CS bachelor\u2019s (already had a bachelors in an unrelated field) because I loved coding, and once I graduated I started a software development job. I\u2019m now about 2 years into that job, 1 year with my current team. And I\u2019m finding that the work itself just isn\u2019t enjoyable. I loved my classes in school and really enjoyed the problem solving aspects, like my discrete math and data science classes, and solving my programming projects in general. But I feel like I don\u2019t get to do that much coding at work; so much more of my time is spent on access requests, back and forth with QA, Agile ceremonies, release planning tasks, random infrastructure stuff that my team has to take on\u2014I hate all that stuff. I spend maybe 10% of my time actually doing what I like. I also seriously hate production support. Like, would gladly take a pay cut to avoid doing it. I also don\u2019t do well with full-time remote work, which we\u2019ve transitioned to permanently, and we\u2019ve been losing a lot of devs due to the fact that we\u2019re undergoing a merger, so I\u2019m having to take on projects that are way beyond my skill level and with that much stress, my mental health is in the toilet. \n\nIs this just what development work is like and I need to get over it? Or should I consider a pivot into another related field (and what might that be?)\n\nI would love any and all thoughts and suggestions! Thanks in advance!",

There are times during my regular job where I feel like I hate coding, but the excitement I feel working on side projects has proved that theory wrong. I feel like I'd drop my current job in a heartbeat in favor of freelancing, but I don't have the network of potential clients in order for it to be a reliable source of income.\n  \nIs this a normal feeling?

But now after work, i would feel burnout but it just seems gets worse everyday.\n\nI am thinking of leaving this job since a year ago and wanting to do something else for my career (doing software engineering work in another company or industry, or maybe starting a small business). And during the break, i would probably use the time to first of all enjoy the NOW and stop feeling too anxious about the future, and brush up my skills as well as learning new skills like learning modern web frameworks and such. Maybe start to look for a new job after i feel better about myself and have a fresh mindset.\n\nI have about a year worth of my monthly salary saved up in my bank account, as well as some other liquid assets in some stocks, robo advisor, etc. My expenses are pretty low as I'm living with my family for the past year due to the pandemic.\n\nTL;DR: Burned out from work, and feeling depressed lately. Wanting to quit the job and take a break for some time to de stress and re-calibrate myself. \n\nSo what do you guys think? Should i quit my job now and take a break for 1-3 months? \n\nOr anyone with similar experience can share their thoughts here.",

I started off with C++, learned reverse engineering a bit, did graphics programming, UI development, etc. Around the end of highschool I realized that kind of work is \"specialized\", and really hard for a young guy with no degree to get a job with regardless of skill, so I started learning web development with VueJS, NodeJs, MongoDb, etc. I have been applying to anything on Indeed with the word \"intern\" or \"developer\" or \"web\" in it, and I've gotten 2 interviews so far in the last 2-3 months. First one was way out of my league (idk why they even bothered with me) and the second one, they interviewed me for an internship position that was already filled. Probably dodged a bullet there but anyways...\n\nI don't know what else I can be/should be doing, I just want to make money with the many skills I've worked hard to learn. I have a personal website/portfolio with a few projects on it ( here: [https://lunaranomaly.com](https://lunaranomaly.com/)), from there you are able to download my resume and a link to my github if you feel like reviewing it.\n\nI've also started trying to freelance (as of today, I re-made my [Freelancer.com](https://freelancer.com/) profile) and the kinds of jobs being posted on there are just, from what I can gather, either gatekept by the site itself or they are complete wastes of time; for instance, people wanting to hire someone to complete their coursework for them. It's obviously low quality, and low return. I also have done every step of creating an Upwork account besides upload a profile picture which I'll be doing tomorrow, once I get some sleep and don't look such a mess :P\n\nI've just been fed up lately, I don't know what to do or what I am doing wrong, which is why I am here.\n\nMy questions are:\n\nAm I advertising myself to the wrong people?\n\nAm I applying on the wrong websites (such as Indeed)?\n\nWhat am I mucking up?\n\nIts really hard for me to tell these things as I am only 19, and never had a dev job, so I lack the relevant experience to know what it is that I don't know.\n\nTL;DR: I've been trying to get a dev job for the last 2 months and I feel like I am shooting blanks with my resume/portfolio, not sure what the issue is but I know I am lacking something to attract employers.\n\nThank you for taking the time to read, and if you have any questions, advice, or critiques I will be very responsive to all and it would be \\*greatly\\* appreciated!\n\n\\-T  \n\n\nEDIT: I forgot to mention, I am pursuing a CS degree at UTD, I transferred from a community college so I will be starting my first semester at UTD this Fall.

            "selftext": "I have like documented my entire journey from May 2019, So this may be long to read.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Little Background**\n\n* I graduated from a reputed college in India in Computer Science in May 2019. I hated coding during college and never tried to focus on it. I felt overwhelmed in college due to the competitive environment there.\n* After May 2019, I had no idea what to do after graduation. I never sat for campus placements even though my college had a very nice record. At that time I didn't want to end up in this area.\n* 3 months passed by, I did nothing (I live with my parents) and was just home. Fortunately I had some good friends during college, who suggested me that there's still a chance that I can try to get in the field, If I start fresh, as there's no college pressure now and assured me that I can do it.\n* I was already familiar with python and spent like 2 months (Sept-Oct 2019) doing easy level and then medium level leetcode questions, 1 problem daily. (Focused on only Basic Arrays, strings, linked list and Tree questions).\n* Then my friend suggested me to try Flask, which led me to enroll in a course named Web programming with Python and JS (CS50 WEB) by Harvard University.\n* This course entirely changed my perspective, and was like a direction that lead me deeper in the web development area. I spent (Oct 2019 - Dec 2019) 2-3 months trying to finish this course at my own pace. \n* I already knew HTML and CSS before. Some stuff I learned through this course were Git, basic db stuff, Flask, Basic JS concepts, Django, dom manipulation, and concepts related to scaling, security etc.\n* So with this course, I created like 4 projects from scratch, some using Flask, and some using django. And I hosted this apps on Heroku. And then started applying for jobs(Jan 2020 - )\n* So initially I felt overwhelmed while applying, as I never interviewed before. But eventually coped up with it and kept applying and interviewing. I got very less interviews.\n\n**COVID period** \n\n* Then COVID came around March 2020 first week and it added to my already demotivated journey of job hunting.\n* During that time I learned Angular. And tried to revamp my previous projects (which were just static sites) with angular and I integrated them. During this time I learnt many new things about JS, I deeply learnt about how Web works, how Internet works, Networking concepts, HTTP, REST, OOPs and all the basic stuff.\n* So I had a pretty good idea about what kind of questions I should expect from an interview and I would prepare accordingly.\n* Around August 2020 last week, one of a no name angel list startup offered me an internship role for 2 months with a joke of stipend. As I was desperate and had no prior internship, I accepted this opportunity and spend two months remotely doing this internship.\n\n**Internship (Sept - Nov 2020)**\n\n* Even though there were like literally 5-6 people in the company, and I knew that I'm just a cheap labor in name of an intern, I tried to make most out of it, and learned many new things there as well. I had no regrets.\n* They even offered me Full time role, again with joke of a salary. But this time I declined, as there was no proper structure, no testing, nothing. And I had a feeling that I would now get a new job quickly but it wasn't like so.\n\n**After Internship (Nov 2020 - March 2021)**\n\n* So again I started applying. Usually I'd try to apply like 20 companies on a single day. Or some weeks I'd apply daily to like 4-5 companies.\n* From when I started tracking (from July 2020) of which companies I've applied to in Google sheets file, I've applied to around 250+ companies. I know that's a huge number of companies. It has come down to how good your resume is, and whether your cover letter is good enough.\n* Mostly from these applications I had potentially like 15 companies where I had gone through at least one round of hiring process seriously.\n* I had many phone screens as well, where sometimes the company didn't considered me a good fit, while other times it was vice versa.\n* And also I've been ghosted by many after interviews.\n* During this period, I have encountered mostly take-home tasks and very few leet code style screenings.\n* I would only do the take-homes If I feel that I'm not being used as a free labor. Also I had learnt about Nodejs during intern, So I would try to learn new stuff, and also try to create new projects. But mostly I would try to revamp or improve my existing ones.\n\n**Breakthrough**\n\n* So I came across the company (which is a well known startup in India) from which I got the offer. I came to know about this company in Feb 2021 when I saw a tweet from someone on my TL related to the company. So I went on their website and applied from there.\n* So I had like 4 rounds with them which lasted for almost a month\n   * Basic Technical Discussion\n   * Take home task -> Code Review + A Live task was given, to make an improvement in the code that I submitted.\n   * Another technical round (DS, Algorithms and System design questions)\n   * Final round with CTO (technical discussion type, cultural fit check)\n* I knew that all of my rounds went well and I had cleared all the rounds as HR informed me that they have positive feedback.\n* I usually try to avoid initiating salary discussion from my end and try my best to not give a number from my side, during initial phases.\n* After all rounds were over they then asked me about the expected CTC. So I was prepared for that, I had already researched on glassdoor like what the company provides to same role in the same location. Now I had this range with me which I needed to mention when asked.\n* So I quoted for a salary range that I never would have even thought about an year before. I was undervaluing myself very much to like almost half of what I quoted.\n* They accepted my quoted range and offer me the lower bound one. I wanted to play safe as I had no other offers, but even though I tried asking if there's any room for increment. HR said they might need to discuss internally. When they shared the letter, it was more than what they initially offered and I was happy with that.\n\n**Some thoughts/ Approaches that I followed**\n\n* I am from India, so there might be some different approaches in reaching out to companies as this sub is mostly US based. Mostly I've applied through Indeed, Linked In, sometimes through angel list and through any leads I could get. I even try to get list of some good companies and would literally apply on their career section. Obviously I didn't aim for any FAANG. I just wanted to enter in the industry with average salary (that doesn't mean you aim low).\n* Although this approach has very less success. One advice I got was to get referrals from your network. But I didn't try getting referrals as I was kind of shy in asking (big mistake and setback for me). \n* I prepared a Google keep, where I stored all the links to blogs, concepts, articles which I could refer to before interview. My intern role was more frontend based, but I tried to learn backend as well and would apply for Full Stack roles. So this was kind of slow down factor, and I believed that I should have just focused on one of them. \n* Before an interview, I say this to myself that it's nothing but a discussion, and no one is gonna judge me.\n* Most difficult thing when an interview begins is to answer the question \"Tell Me about yourself?\". Your answer to this question would be like a foundation for how your rest of the interview is gonna be.\n   *  And I know when you have a gap and no prior experience, it kind of becomes awkward answering that.\n   * I would begin describing my graduation year and major.\n   * What I did after college, how would I utilize my time, which technologies I learnt.\n   * What's the most recent experience I had, If any.\n* I knew that I have drastically improved my communication skills over this period. And I added that to my advantage.\n* I would always try to be humble when interviewing, and would always speak softly. If I didn't know about something, I would simply say that I'm not aware about that and might have to look. Or I would politely ask them If they could tell me the answer (depends on situation).\n* Reverse interview questions are important and you definitely need to ask interviewer questions at the end, to standout from others. Questions should be interesting and should be framed in a way that can make the interviewer more attentive towards you.\n* After every interview,  I would note about which things I wasn't able to answer in a doc file, so I wouldn't miss that next time.\n* There were times were I felt burn out and demotivated. So it's okay to take a break and one should know when to take them.\n* I have been an active member on this subreddit since I started job searching, also I followed some cool people on tech twitter, which were helpful in some way or other.\n* At last, I'm satisfied with what I have presently, and the wait and journey was worth it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TL;DR**\n\n\n* Began my job hunting journey from scratch after my graduation in CS.\n* No prior Internships.\n* Built projects during the time.\n* Landed an internship in a small startup. They offered full time, but I declined.\n* Started job search again.\n* 250+ applications.\n* Got an offer I never would have imagined one year before.\n\n**PS**\n\n\n* This post was meant for motivating others who are on the same boat. If someone like me could do this, you definitely can.\n* I won't mention the company name or my college name as I prefer to be anonymous on reddit.\n*  I don't want to directly reveal the CTC as well but for those people who are asking me, its closer to the lower bound of 10-15 LPA range",

So although I don't have an official offer from them yet Its pretty darn close.\n\nNow I don't want the job, and in order to not let them down I want to find a new one asap before my start date in 7 weeks.

I referred my previous coworker (through my current company's referral app, so her application is tied to my name) to apply for my same exact job (we have several openings). Her and I both started in our roles at the previous company within 2 months of each other. We both have unrelated bachelors degrees, I have an MBA and the CBAP certification. (Like the PMP for Business Analysts). \n\nIn her initial interview, the HR representative quoted her a salary range that, at a minimum is like $30 more per year than I'm currently making, and at its maximum is 20k more than I am currently making. If she were to receive an offer for more than I am making, it would bother me knowing that as I have more education and more tenure with the company with otherwise completely equal experience. (Literally our previous company and position and the types of projects we worked on were the exact same). \n\nIs it reasonable to try to request a pay increase based on this information should she accept an offer at a higher salary than me? They should not be surprised that I know her offer details as I am her referring employee and they legally cannot prevent us from discussing pay. That just seems ridiculous to me that they'd pay a new hire with less qualifications more than someone who has been there for over a year. However, I don't know if this is considered a legitimate reason for asking for a pay raise.

Good to learn Git flow and good for first impression. Ask for a review of commit first.\n* Don't step on dogs and also punch a Senior dev in the face.",

            "selftext": "tl;dr: boss I made a HR complaint at (that was acted on) one of my old jobs is being hired at a role senior to me at my new job, I only found out after they extended an offer. What're my options?\n\nThrowaway for very obvious reasons. I'm fuzzing the details a little bit, also for obvious reasons. \n\nOnly seniors and above are in the interview loop in my company, and I'm mid level. I've been here 2.5 years and this is a new change. \n\nOld boss \"inherited\" me at my old job when my first boss left. We never got along before that. Since we worked together at a huge company he did a lot of bureaucratic things to try and \"manage me out,\" like reassign all my work to his other other reports, then write me up for not doing as much as them. There was also definitely a racial component to it because we're different races and he only hired people of his race. \n\nRight around then, I went on FMLA leave because my mother had a stroke. When I came back he had a PIP written up for me, so that plus the racial stuff prompted me to go to HR and amp up my job hunt. I found out he was smack talking me to other people, too. On one of my interviews, the interviewer said \"we don't have use for people who decide to just take six months off because they can't handle the pace.\" This was almost the exact same wording he used, and LinkedIn searching showed me they went to the same school, same major, and same graduating class. I took this to HR and they formally disciplined him, and I saved those emails. \n\nI only found out he was hired today, because during our sprint planning the team lead announced he accepted an offer for a senior engineer role and we marked off some tine to onboard him. \n\nSo what do I do? My boss loves me, I'm scheduled for a promotion, and I have enough savings to sustain a year+ long job hunt, and I have a pretty good resume. But I really have no idea how to bring this to my boss.",

            "selftext": "**Job Title:** \"Jr. Software Engineer in Test\"\n\n**Background:** Technically I am not a developer, I test the functionality of the software that developers write although I do write code here and there for my tests.  My company is small, around 60 employes and has been in business for 23 years.  They make tracking devices for construction vehicles, care centers, hospitals, maritime, and more. This is my first real job out of college in an actual tech company.  It's a fast-paced agile environment. \n\n**Week 1:** Trainings, creating accounts, settings up my development environment, installing OS and user apps on my hardware device.  My first week was super stressful because everything was very new to me, I was lacking basic hardware and networking knowledge, and it was hard to adapt.\n\n**Week 2:** After getting everything set up, I was mostly learning how to use Jira, running a simple test, and recording results.  It was the most chill week as I was doing basic stuff.\n\n**Week 3 - 7:** A test engineer on a different project put in his 2 weeks notice (he was the only tester on that project) so I had to learn everything about that project and take it over while working on the other project.  Created many test cases for both projects and executed them.  The work was always stressful, long hours, but I was able to kinda handle it.\n\n**Week 8 - 9:** As I was struggling with the first 2 projects, a HW engineer come up to me, says he is going on vacation, and gives me a 30 min confusing tutorial on the work I must get done the next day for testing the cell module FW.  The following week I had to set up an FTP server and perform some functional tests to do related to cell module FW that was also very hard to do.  These were the highest priority tests according to the program manager, lots of pressure, and stress.  Friday of the last week was my breaking point when the program manager came to work all pissed off, we had a stressful meeting and he was assigning more shit to do for another project I had.  Things I had no idea what to do.   The stress at this point was insane and was on the day I had to turn in the document of whether I will stay and continue working with them or not.  I could not sign.\n\n**Week 9 - 11:** On Monday I formally resigned to my higher-ups. They gave me fewer tasks to do since I was leaving and was only working on one project. The work was a lot easier and I was not stressed out.  On the 2nd to last day, I gave my test team and others gifts to leave off on a good note and to thank them for teaching me.\n\n**Summary:** There were some good moments during this job but a lot of bad moments.  Overall I always felt stressed out and especially during weeks 8 and 9, the stress was unbearable, to the point where I was crying every day after work, thinking how the hell am I going to survive here.  There was even one point where I was crying at my desk and the senior engineer took me outside to talk to me and calm me down.  I couldn't learn anything, was getting really bad brain fog, and could not retain information.  I literally had to tape-record everything I did and play it back later to remember.  My brain was not performing properly and this had never happened to me before.  The decision to leave my first job out of college 3 months in was the hardest decision of my life.  The amount of failure and guilt I felt for leaving my team behind was unbearable.   Everyone (besides the CEO who would yell at people every day) was overall cool and good people, especially my test team.  I thought to myself \"if this is how it's like as jr during my probation period, how is going to be like 6 months from now?\"  My desire to be a software engineer was being killed.  I figured things will not get any better and I had to make this choice, for my mental health, and career.  Now I have to start all over again finding a job but at least I had the courage to leave and do what is right for me.",
