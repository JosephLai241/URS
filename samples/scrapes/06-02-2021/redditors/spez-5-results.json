I founded GameChanger in 2007 when my son Taylor was going through a 5-year battle with leukemia. Taylor and I saw the need to help families struggling to pay their bills gain access to safe, Ad free premium content,  games, and educational tools. That is what motivated us to created GameChanger - to help democratize access. We've donated more than $26 million in support and technology to families and hospitals and now are partnering with some of the biggest companies and influencers in gaming and tech.\n\n\nSocial Links:\nhttps://twitter.com/GameChangerOrg\nhttps://www.facebook.com/gamechangerorg\nhttps://gamechangercharity.org/ \n\n\nProof:\nhttps://i.redd.it/mdnrsrkv35171.jpg",

Our top priority at reddit is to develop a comprehensive Content Policy and the tools to enforce it.\n\nThe overwhelming majority of content on reddit comes from wonderful, creative, funny, smart, and silly communities. That is what makes reddit great. There is also a dark side, communities whose purpose is reprehensible, and we don\u2019t have any obligation to support them. And we also believe that some communities currently on the platform should not be here at all.\n\nNeither Alexis nor I created reddit to be a bastion of free speech, but rather as a place where open and honest discussion can happen:  These are very complicated issues, and we are putting a lot of thought into it. It\u2019s something we\u2019ve been thinking about for quite some time.  We haven\u2019t had the tools to enforce policy, but now we\u2019re building those tools and reevaluating our policy.\n\nWe as a community need to decide together what our values are. To that end, I\u2019ll be hosting an AMA on Thursday 1pm pst to present our current thinking to you, the community, and solicit your feedback.\n\nPS - I won\u2019t be able to hang out in comments right now. Still meeting everyone here!",

                    "selftext": "Hi All,\n\nWhat happened in Orlando this weekend was a national tragedy. Let\u2019s remember that first and foremost, this was a devastating and visceral human experience that many individuals and whole communities were, and continue to be, affected by. In the grand scheme of things, this is what is most important today.\n\nI would like to address what happened on Reddit this past weekend. Many of you use Reddit as your primary source of news, and we have a duty to provide access to timely information during a crisis. This is a responsibility we take seriously.\n\nThe story broke on r/news, as is common. In such situations, their community is flooded with all manners of posts. Their policy includes removing duplicate posts to focus the conversation in one place, and removing speculative posts until facts are established. A few posts were removed incorrectly, which have now been restored. One moderator did cross the line with their behavior, and is no longer a part of the team. We have seen the accusations of censorship. We have investigated, and beyond the posts that are now restored, have not found evidence to support these claims.\n\nWhether you agree with r/news\u2019 policies or not, it is never acceptable to harass users or moderators. Expressing your anger is fine. Sending death threats is not. We will be taking action against users, moderators, posts, and communities that encourage such behavior.\n\nWe are working with r/news to understand the challenges faced and their actions taken throughout, and we will work more closely with moderators of large communities in future times of crisis. We\u2013Reddit Inc, moderators, and users\u2013all have a duty to ensure access to timely information is available.\n\nIn the wake of this weekend, we will be making a handful of technology and process changes:\n\n* Live threads are the best place for news to break and for the community to stay updated on the events. We are working to make this more timely, evident, and organized.\n* [We\u2019re introducing a change to Sticky Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/changelog/comments/4ny8y6/renaming_sticky_posts_to_announcements/): They\u2019ll now be called Announcement Posts, which better captures their intended purpose; they will only be able to be created by moderators; and they must be text posts. Votes will continue to count. We are making this change to prevent the use of Sticky Posts to organize bad behavior.\n* We are working on a change to the r/all algorithm to promote more diversity in the feed, which will help provide more variety of viewpoints and prevent vote manipulation.\n* We are nearly fully staffed on our Community team, and will continue increasing support for moderator teams of major communities.\n\nAgain, what happened in Orlando is horrible, and above all, we need to keep things in perspective. We\u2019ve all been set back by the events, but we will move forward together to do better next time. ",

I\u2019ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**\n\nHi all,\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again when we share Reddit\u2019s annual transparency report.\n\nWe share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it\u2019s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.\n\nYou\u2019ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we\u2019ve expanded the report to include new data\u2014specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.\n\n## By the numbers\n\nSince the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I\u2019ll call out a few stats below:\n\n**ADMIN REMOVALS**\n\n* In 2019, we removed **\\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.\n* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed\n   * **222k** **pieces of content**,\n   * **55.9k accounts**, and\n   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).\n* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.\n\n**LEGAL REMOVALS**\n\n* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.\n* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.\n\n**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**\n\n* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.\n   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).\n   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.\n   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).\n* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)\n\n## While I have your attention...\n\nI\u2019d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.\n\nWhen we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to \u201cforce subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.\u201d While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn\u2019t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.\n\nToday, we\u2019re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.\n\n## If you\u2019ve read this far\n\nIn addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we\u2019re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.\n\n**As usual, I\u2019ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments. AMA.**\n\nUpdate: I'm off for now. Thanks for questions, everyone.",

                    "selftext": "I would like to share some of the things we have been up to since we last chatted.\n\nOn the product side, we\u2019ve been busy. Both our [iPhone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.reddit.frontpage&hl=en) apps have had [multiple releases](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditmobile), and we\u2019re proud at how well they are progressing. Mobile web (m.reddit.com) is undergoing a major overhaul that we\u2019re testing internally, and hope to start showing to users in the next couple weeks. We have been running many experiments on desktop web to increase user engagement, particularly for users who are new to Reddit. You can see what experiments we are running on this [live thread](https://www.reddit.com/live/x3ckzbsj6myw/), and notable changes to the site are listed in r/changelog.\n\nWe\u2019ve started development on a new frontpage algorithm. The current algorithm is outdated and is no longer meeting our needs. There are a number of problems we\u2019d like to solve: increased velocity, improved personalization, reduced dependence on /new, and not requiring us to choose the defaults. We\u2019re still in the early days, but I\u2019m happy we\u2019re dedicating resources to it.\n\nAs it relates to monetization, we\u2019ve made a handful of changes: we [tested adding affiliate tags](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4mv578/affiliate_links_on_reddit/) to e-commerce links, which we ended up turning off; we announced [Promoted User Posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4upf11/new_ad_type_promoted_user_posts/); and we announced [tests we\u2019ll be running](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/4phzsi/sponsored_headline_tests_placement_and_design/) on sponsored headlines. Changes and additions to ads can be met with skepticism, and this is why we test changes carefully and listen to feedback. As we evolve our ads platform, we are working to do it in a way that that complements the core experience and engages redditors. These changes and experiments will continue to happen, but while it is critical that we build Reddit into a sustainable business, we don\u2019t want to compromise what\u2019s brought us here. Going forward, we will list these in r/changelog so all these kinds of announcements are in one place.\n\nYesterday, we previewed [new moderator mail](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/4wwzzs/new_modmail_a_demo_and_a_call_for_beta_testers/) to moderators. This has been a long time coming, and we\u2019re excited to show it off. The current moderator mail system is a hack on top of our messaging system, which is itself a hack on top of our commenting system. The new tool should save a lot of time for everyone, and new tech stack will allow for better future iterations and builds. We\u2019ll be working with moderators to refine it while we work towards a full rollout.\n\nWe\u2019ve seen great results from our Anti-Evil, Trust & Safety, and Community teams. The mandate of these teams is to eliminate spam and abuse and to ensure Reddit is a welcoming place for all. In the last quarter, we\u2019ve reduced harassment reports by 15%, spam reports by 66%, and moderator spam removals by 15%. We\u2019ve also reduced our support ticket backlog substantially, dropping our average response time from 64 hours to 7 in the process.\n\nHappy to chat about this stuff, or anything else.\n\ne: grammar\n\nu: Thank you! Heading out for now. Will check back later.",

You may not be able to vote me out, but you can vote everyone else out.\n\n\u2014\n\nHello again!\n\nIt\u2019s been a minute since [my last post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8bb85p/reddits_2017_transparency_report_and_suspect/), so I wanted to take some time out from our usual product and policy updates, [meme safety reports](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8we31l/the_memes_are_safe_repeat_the_memes_are_safe_for/), and waiting for r/livecounting [to reach 10,000,000](https://www.reddit.com/live/ta535s1hq2je/) to share some highlights from the past few months and talk about our plans for the months ahead.\n\nWe started off the quarter with a [win for net neutrality](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/8jzyb6/update_we_won_the_net_neutrality_vote_in_the/), but as always, the fight against the Dark Side continues, with [Europe passing a new copyright directive](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17851962/eu-copyright-directive-wikimedia-google-twitter-europe) that may strike a real blow to the open internet. Nevertheless, we will continue to fight for the open internet (and occasionally pester you with posts encouraging you to fight for it, too).\n\nWe also had a lot of fun fighting for the *not-so-free* but perfectly balanced world of r/thanosdidnothingwrong. I\u2019m always amazed to see redditors so engaged with their communities that they get [Snoo tattoos](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanosdidnothingwrong/comments/8zcga8/perfectly_balanced_as_all_things_should_be/). \n\nSpeaking of bans, you\u2019ve probably noticed that over the past few months we\u2019ve banned a few subreddits and [quarantined](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/) several more. We don't take the banning of subreddits lightly, but we will continue to enforce our policies (and be transparent with all of you when we make changes to them) and use other tools to encourage a healthy ecosystem for communities. We\u2019ve been investing heavily in our Anti-Evil and Trust & Safety teams, as well as a new team devoted solely to investigating and preventing efforts to interfere with our site, state-sponsored and otherwise. We also recognize the ways that redditors themselves actively help flag potential suspicious actors, and we\u2019re working on a system to allow you all to [report directly to this team](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModSupport/comments/9hjkv5/so_about_those_suspicious_activity_reports/).\n\nOn the product side, our teams have been hard at work shipping countless updates to our [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reddit-the-official-app/id1064216828?mt=8) and [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=reddit+Inc.&hl=en) apps, like universal search and News. We\u2019ve also expanded Chat on mobile and desktop and launched an opt-in subreddit chat, which we\u2019ve already seen communities using for game-day discussions and chats about TV shows. We started testing out a new hub for [OC (Original Content)](https://www.reddit.com/original) and a [Save Drafts feature](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8k8d1x/beta_new_save_draft_feature_for_text_and_link/) (with shared drafts as well) for text and link posts in the redesign. \n\nSpeaking of which, we\u2019ve made a ton of improvements to the redesign since we last talked about it in April. \n\nIncluding but not limited to\u2026 night mode, user & post flair improvements, [better traffic pages for ](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/)\n\n[mods](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/954a8p/traffic_page_update_see_your_subreddits_traffic/), accessibility improvements, keyboard shortcuts, a bunch of new community widgets, fixing key AutoMod integrations, and the ability to [have community styling show up on mobile as well](https://i.redd.it/l12cv7lqmwf11.png), which was one of the main reasons why we took on the redesign in the first place. I know you all have had a lot of feedback since we first launched it ([I have too](https://www.reddit.com/r/redesign/comments/8d8qws/despite_everyone_saying_the_redesign_is_perfect/)). Our teams have poured a tremendous amount of work into shipping improvements, and their #1 focus now is on improving performance. If you haven\u2019t checked it out in a while, I encourage you to [give it a spin](http://new.reddit.com/).\n\nLast but not least, on the community front, we just wrapped our second annual Moderator Thank You Roadshow, where the rest of the admins and I got the chance to meet mods in different cities, have [a bit of fun](https://www.reddit.com/r/boston/comments/8u5cca/quick_while_we_are_all_at_the_game/), and chat about Reddit. We also launched a new [Mod Help Center](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/9bnj3a/we_launched_a_new_knowledge_base_for_mods_and_we/) and new mod tools for Chat and the redesign, with more fun stuff (like Modmail Search) on the way.\n\nOther than that, I can\u2019t imagine we have much to talk about, but I\u2019ll hang to around some questions anyway.\n\n\u2014spez",

It was inspiring to witness [organic takeovers](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/7j8fkt/an_analysis_of_net_neutrality_activism_on_reddit/) of the front page \\(twice\\), read touching [stories](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/) about how net neutrality matters in users\u2019 everyday lives, see bills about net neutrality [discussed on the front page](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/7j6kn4/congress_has_set_out_a_bill_to_stop_the_fcc/) \\(with over 100,000 upvotes and cross-posts to over 100 communities\\), and watch redditors exercise their voices as citizens in the [hundreds of thousands of calls](https://thenextweb.com/insider/2017/11/22/reddit-net-neutrality-fcc-protest/) they drove to Congress.\n\nIt is disappointing that the FCC Chairman plowed ahead with his planned repeal despite all of this [public concern](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/12/12/this-poll-gave-americans-a-detailed-case-for-and-against-the-fccs-net-neutrality-plan-the-reaction-among-republicans-was-striking/?hpid=hp_hp-cards_hp-card-technology%3Ahomepage%2Fcard&utm_term=.d11780a12cc2), not to mention the [objections expressed by his fellow commissioners](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/12/16766324/fcc-commissioners-clyburn-rosenworcel-net-neutrality), [the FCC\u2019s own CTO](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/12/13/net-neutrality-repeal-warning-eric-burger-fcc-259968), [more than a hundred members of Congress](https://doyle.house.gov/sites/doyle.house.gov/files/documents/20171213DoyleNDelayLtrAll.pdf), [dozens of senators, and the very builders of the modern internet](https://www.salon.com/2017/12/12/senators-internet-pioneers-pen-letters-to-fcc-asking-to-cancel-thursdays-net-neutrality-vote/). \n\nNevertheless, today\u2019s vote is the beginning, not the end. While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.\n\nMany of you have asked what comes next. We don\u2019t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC\u2019s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It\u2019s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren\u2019t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.\n\nWhat is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you\u2019ve created. Those who thought that they\u2019d be able to quietly repeal net neutrality without anyone noticing or caring learned a thing or two, and we still may come out on top of this yet. We\u2019ll keep you informed as things develop.\n\nu\\/arabscarab \\(Jessica, our head of policy\\) will also be in the comments to address your questions. \n\n\u2014u\\/spez & u\\/kn0thing\n\nupdate: Please note the FCC is not united in this decision and find the dissenting statements from commissioners [Clyburn and Rosenworcel](https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/14/16776712/fcc-commissioners-democrat-statements-net-neutrality).\n\nupdate2 (9:55AM pst): While the vote has not technically happened, we decided to post after the two dissenting commissioners released their statements.

We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. \n\nWe\u2019ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. \n\n* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee\u2019s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.\n* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.\n* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.\n\nDebate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit\u2014including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself\u2014as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure\u2019s name should not get you banned.\n\nWe care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too.

We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.\n\nHi All,\n\nI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\n\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\n\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).\n\nI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\n\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\n\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\n\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\n\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\n\n* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\nPosts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.\n\n* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.\n\nAgain, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.\n\nSteve\n\nPS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users. You can modify the filters by [visiting r/all on the desktop web](https://g.redditmedia.com/34sCU-v1SO7xXrFliAOHfMR2bVjuoC2xYPV3OnH6C9Y.gif?w=1024&fm=mp4&mp4-fragmented=false&s=c4127836f34b00ac6a66b1b429e02440) (I\u2019m old, sorry), but it will affect all platforms, including our native apps on iOS and Android.\n",

Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we\u2019ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.\n\n## First, some background\n\nPolitical ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.\n\nSince debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads\u2014providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments\u2014but so far it\u2019s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.\n\n## The problem we\u2019re addressing\n\nAs I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM\u2019s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.\n\nIf the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it\u2019s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it\u2019s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.\n\nThe problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It\u2019s fair to say that r/announcements isn\u2019t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.\n\nUltimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.\n\n## What we\u2019re testing today\n\nInstead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities\u2014an approach we hope works for political ads as well.\n\nBelow is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.\n\nA few other details to note for this test:\n\n* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.\n* **Communities that don\u2019t want to participate don\u2019t have to.** (If you\u2019re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)\n* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.\n* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won\u2019t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.\n* **After today\u2019s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**\n\nThis test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even\u2014and perhaps particularly\u2014if they are critical.\n\n## How we\u2019re answering questions\n\nr/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don\u2019t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).\n\nFor today, we\u2019re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods\u2019 questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we\u2019ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we\u2019ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).\n\nUltimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.\n\nThank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.\n\nSteve\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we\u2019ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. \n\nAs I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.\n\nWe\u2019re still exploring how we\u2019ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them. In the meantime, you can see our updated political ads policy on our [Advertising Policy Help Page](https://advertising.reddithelp.com/en/categories/reddit-advertising-policy/reddit-advertising-policy-overview).",

I\u2019ll stick around to answer your questions about the report (and other topics) in the comments.**\n\nHi all,\n\nIt\u2019s that time of year again when we share Reddit\u2019s annual transparency report.\n\nWe share this report each year because you have a right to know how user data is being managed by Reddit, and how it\u2019s both shared and not shared with government and non-government parties.\n\nYou\u2019ll find information on content removed from Reddit and requests for user information. This year, we\u2019ve expanded the report to include new data\u2014specifically, a breakdown of content policy removals, content manipulation removals, subreddit removals, and subreddit quarantines.\n\n## By the numbers\n\nSince the [full report](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/transparency-report-2019) is rather long, I\u2019ll call out a few stats below:\n\n**ADMIN REMOVALS**\n\n* In 2019, we removed **\\~53M** pieces of content in total, mostly for spam and content manipulation (e.g. brigading and vote cheating), exclusive of legal/copyright removals, which we track separately.\n* For [Content Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) violations, we removed\n   * **222k** **pieces of content**,\n   * **55.9k accounts**, and\n   * **21.9k** **subreddits** (**87%** of which were removed for being unmoderated).\n* Additionally, we quarantined **256 subreddits**.\n\n**LEGAL REMOVALS**\n\n* Reddit received **110 requests** from government entities to remove content, of which we complied with **37.3%**.\n* In 2019 we removed about **5x more** content for copyright infringement than in 2018, largely due to copyright notices for adult-entertainment and notices targeting pieces of content that had already been removed.\n\n**REQUESTS FOR USER INFORMATION**\n\n* We received a total of **772 requests** for user account information from law enforcement and government entities.\n   * **366** of these were emergency disclosure requests, mostly from US law enforcement (**68%** of which we complied with).\n   * **406** were non-emergency requests (**73%** of which we complied with); most were US subpoenas.\n   * Reddit received an additional **224 requests** to temporarily preserve certain user account information (**86%** of which we complied with).\n* Note: We carefully review each request for compliance with applicable laws and regulations. If we determine that a request is not legally valid, Reddit will challenge or reject it. (You can read more in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/privacy-policy) and [Guidelines for Law Enforcement](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/guidelines-for-law-enforcement).)\n\n## While I have your attention...\n\nI\u2019d like to share an update about our thinking around quarantined communities.\n\nWhen we [expanded our quarantine policy](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/), we created an appeals process for sanctioned communities. One of the goals was to \u201cforce subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivize moderators to make changes.\u201d While the policy attempted to hold moderators more accountable for enforcing healthier rules and norms, it didn\u2019t address the role that each member plays in the health of their community.\n\nToday, we\u2019re making an update to address this gap: Users who consistently upvote policy-breaking content within quarantined communities will receive automated warnings, followed by further consequences like a temporary or permanent suspension. We hope this will encourage healthier behavior across these communities.\n\n## If you\u2019ve read this far\n\nIn addition to this report, we share news throughout the year from teams across Reddit, and if you like posts about what we\u2019re doing, you can stay up to date and talk to our teams in r/RedditSecurity, r/ModNews, r/redditmobile, and r/changelog.\n\n**As usual, I\u2019ll be sticking around to answer your questions in the comments. AMA.**\n\nUpdate: I'm off for now. Thanks for questions, everyone.",

Taylor and I saw the need to help families struggling to pay their bills gain access to safe, Ad free premium content,  games, and educational tools. That is what motivated us to created GameChanger - to help democratize access.

We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. \n\nWe\u2019ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. \n\n* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee\u2019s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.\n* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.\n* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.\n\nDebate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit\u2014including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself\u2014as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure\u2019s name should not get you banned.\n\nWe care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we\u2019ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.\n\nWe did not operate to our own standards here. We will do our best to do better for you.",

None of that Tumblr business around here.\n\n\n[Check out the history of Gif Battles!](/r/HighQualityGifs/wiki/battles)\n# Rules\n\n1. All gifs must be high-quality gifs. That's the name of the subreddit, so our hands are tied. We hope you understand. Please review our criteria here: /r/HighQualityGifs/wiki/submission_criteria\n\n2. **Please only post gifs that you made yourself and use direct links only. Attempting to pass off someone else's content as your own will result in post removal and may result in a ban.** \n\n3. All criticism in the comments section must be constructive. **Complaints about gif quality or meta gifs will be removed, and you may be banned as a result.** Our users spend a lot of time making these gifs. Be nice to them. There's room for gifs of all kinds here.\n\n4. **Please don't make more than 20 posts within a 1-week period.** It's a bunch, if you abuse it we might start to care.\n\n5. Direct links are required, meaning that the URL must end in \".gif, .gifv, .webm\" etc.\n\n6. Please tag NSFW posts when appropriate. **No nudity, no gifs from porn videos, and no real-life gore.**\n\n7. Personal attacks, racism, bigotry, homophobia, witch hunts, etc will not be tolerated. Don't mention or complain about rules or mod teams of any subreddit.\n\n8. We do not allow participation of users from hatereddits that ban due to actions in other subreddits.\n\n9. **No Sound... Ever**   ..... *Apart from sound Sundays*\n\n10. **Do not delete and repost a gif to make it perform better.** Not every gif will make the front page\n\n* Requests for gif-making help/advice are encouraged. Blank frames? Strange frame rate? We can help.\n\n* Made a new gif for /r/reactiongifs? /r/gifs? /r/mylittlepony? Post it here too! (maybe skip the pony gifs).\n\n* This is not a super serious sub. We are all trying to have fun here. If you want to come to this place just to be a dick you will be banned. The submitters here are going out of their way to make content for the world for free, remember that. If you act like a dick you will be banned. \n\n# Tutorials\n\nFor good gif-making tutorials, see the sidebars of these subreddits:\n\n**Making gifs in Photoshop?**\n\n* [EditingAndLayout (.gif king of reddit) will help you out](http://goo.gl/fH4qiW)\n\n**Making gifs in After Effects?

Did you feel *out of the loop*? This subreddit is dedicated to helping you get up to speed with the recent trends and news. \n\n---\n###Links to view before submitting\n-| -|\n:---:|:---:\n[Subreddit Rules](/r/OutOfTheLoop/w/rules)|[Urban Dictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/)\n[Retired Questions](/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions)|[Know Your Meme](http://knowyourmeme.com/)\n[What is a Loop?](https://redd.it/77cda0)|[Google](https://www.google.com/)\n\n---\n####Rules\n#1. Post title must be a current, unbiased, and coherent question\n- The title is the most important aspect to creating a post. If it's hard for other users to understand what you are asking then it will be hard to get an answer. \n - **Current** - The topic of the post you are creating must be a trending event that has happened recently.\n - **Unbiased** - Don't put your own twist on it to make it come off negative or positive. Try to be as neutral as possible. \n - **Coherent** - Write a complete question that is clear about what you are trying to ask. Don't simply put one word and a question mark. \n - **Format** - [Include the format listed here](/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/titles)\n\n\n#2. Post must include context and resources in the body of the text\n- Context is key when trying to find a proper answer. The more we know about what you are asking, the better we can answer with more information. \n - **Context** - Add some words to your post so there is more to work with than a title. Words such as; what you saw, where you saw it, how often you saw it. \n - **Resources** - You obviously saw it somewhere; link to the thing that made you ask. Or include a screenshot.  \n\n\n#3. No ad nauseum, recently reposted, or retired questions\n- Often times what you are asking has already been answered. Be sure to search the [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/search), [Google](https://www.google.com/), and [KnowYourMeme](http://knowyourmeme.com/) before creating a new post.\n - **Ad nauseum** - The topic in question has been discussed extensively, and that those involved in the discussion have grown tired of it.\n - **Recently reposted** - A topic is popular and is posted multiple times within a short period of time.\n - **Retired** - The '[Big List of Retired Questions](http://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/wiki/index/retired_questions)' is a wiki page created by the mods that lists overly asked questions that have been thoroughly answered. Duplicates of retired questions may be removed.\n\n#4. Top-level comments must begin with \"Answer:\", and be a genuine, unbiased, and coherent answer\n- People are here to find answers for their questions. If top-level comments are riddled with memes or non-answers then no one wins. \n - **Begin with \"Answer:\"** - This helps weed out low-effort, rule breaking comments, as well as allows the comments to be more organized.\n - **Genuine** - Attempt to answer with words; don't pop in to tell users to search or drop a link without explanation.\n - **Unbiased** - Answer without putting your own twist of bias towards the answer. However, after you leave an unbiased response, you can add your own opinion as long as it's clearly marked, starting with \"Biased:\".\n - **Coherent** - Write in complete sentences that are clear about what you are trying to say.\n\n#5. Be nice, follow etiquette\n- This subreddit is supposed to be a helpful place for confused redditors.\n - **Be nice** - Be polite in your exchanges, vote based on whether a comment contributes to the discussion and not on whether you agree with the opinion, etc.\n - **Follow etiquette** - When in doubt, refer to [**reddiquette**](http://www.reddit.com/w/reddiquette/).\n\n---\n###Flairs + Filters \n\n[Answered](/r/OutOfTheLoop/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AAnswered#answered) [Unanswered](/r/OutOfTheLoop/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AUnanswered#unanswered)\n\n[Recap Thread](/r/OutOfTheLoop/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ARecap%2BThread#recap)\n[Megathread](/r/OutOfTheLoop/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AMegathread#mega)\n\nOnce you post a question and it's answered, please click the flair button under your post and change the flair to \"Answered\". \n\nYou can also comment with the phrase `[answered]` to flair your post.\n\n---\n###Mod note\nFailure to follow these rules will result in posts or comments being removed, and may result in bans, the length of which to be determined by the nature of the infraction.\n\nMeta threads about OOTL itself should be asked via [sending us a message in modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FOutOfTheLoop).

I founded GameChanger in 2007 when my son Taylor was going through a 5-year battle with leukemia. Taylor and I saw the need to help families struggling to pay their bills gain access to safe, Ad free premium content,  games, and educational tools. That is what motivated us to created GameChanger - to help democratize access. We've donated more than $26 million in support and technology to families and hospitals and now are partnering with some of the biggest companies and influencers in gaming and tech.\n\n\nSocial Links:\nhttps://twitter.com/GameChangerOrg\nhttps://www.facebook.com/gamechangerorg\nhttps://gamechangercharity.org/ \n\n\nProof:\nhttps://i.redd.it/mdnrsrkv35171.jpg",

We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. \n\nWe\u2019ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. \n\n* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee\u2019s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.\n* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.\n* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.\n\nDebate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit\u2014including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself\u2014as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure\u2019s name should not get you banned.\n\nWe care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we\u2019ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.\n\nWe did not operate to our own standards here. We will do our best to do better for you.",

I recently discovered a local wing place that uses cheetos (regular and flaming hot!) as breading for their hot wings. Now... I've not yet tried those, but it got us thinking - what are your favorite spicy recipes? Anything wacky you've tried? \n\nWe for sure want to hear about your wing recipes, we also want to hear about other spicy recipes as well to get our mouths watering before the weekend! \n\nbonus: when eating wings, bleu cheese or nah?

We built a relationship with her first as a mod and then through her contractor work on RPAN. We did not adequately vet her background before formally hiring her. \n\nWe\u2019ve put significant effort into improving how we handle doxxing and harassment, and this employee was the subject of both. In this case, we over-indexed on protection, which had serious consequences in terms of enforcement actions. \n\n* On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee\u2019s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.\n* On March 22nd, a news article about this employee was posted by a mod of r/ukpolitics. The article was removed and the submitter banned by the aforementioned rules. When contacted by the moderators of r/ukpolitics, we reviewed the actions, and reversed the ban on the moderator, and we informed the r/ukpolitics moderation team that we had restored the mod.\n* We updated our rules to flag potential harassment for human review.\n\nDebate and criticism have always been and always will be central to conversation on Reddit\u2014including discussion about public figures and Reddit itself\u2014as long as they are not used as vehicles for harassment. Mentioning a public figure\u2019s name should not get you banned.\n\nWe care deeply for Reddit and appreciate that you do too. We understand the anger and confusion about these issues and their bigger implications. The employee is no longer with Reddit, and we\u2019ll be evolving a number of relevant internal policies.\n\nWe did not operate to our own standards here. We will do our best to do better for you.",

                    "selftext": "In case you missed [the](https://www.reddit.com/r/mildlyinteresting/comments/ikxsst/this_reddit_billboard_advertisement_for_their/) [billboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/ilhck2/saw_one_in_the_wild_make_sure_to_vote_illinois/), [blog posts](https://redditblog.com/2020/09/01/its-national-poll-worker-recruitment-day-become-a-poll-worker-this-election-and-help-power-the-polls-in-your-community/), and [AMAs](https://redditblog.com/2020/08/25/voting-in-america/), we\u2019re doing our best to encourage people on and off Reddit to vote this year. Along with our [Up the Vote campaign](https://redditblog.com/2020/07/29/up-the-vote-reddits-irl-2020-voting-campaign/) and [ongoing security and safety work](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/) to guard against shenanigans, we\u2019ve also been evolving how we handle another important aspect of the election process: **political ads**.\n\n## First, some background\n\nPolitical ads have been a relatively quiet part of Reddit for many years. Last year, in thinking through what the right balance was between unfettered political ads and prohibiting them altogether for 2020 (both approaches that other platforms have taken), we decided on [a policy we felt was the best approach for Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/g0s6tn/changes_to_reddits_political_ads_policy/): no misinformation, human review of the ads and where they link, a subreddit listing all political ads ([r/RedditPoliticalAds](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditPoliticalAds/)), and a requirement to keep comments on for 24 hours.\n\nSince debuting this policy earlier this year, the last condition (requiring comments to remain on) has enabled redditors to discuss political ads\u2014providing more context in the comments and even offering counterarguments\u2014but so far it\u2019s only been lightly used. As we get closer to November, however, the prominence of and discussion around political ads will increase, and, with it, the need for a clear moderation system for these comments.\n\n## The problem we\u2019re addressing\n\nAs I mentioned [a couple months back](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/hi3oht/update_to_our_content_policy/fwdxoty/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3&depth=2), unmoderated spaces on Reddit are an area we want to improve, from Modmail to PM\u2019s, and political ads pose a unique challenge.\n\nIf the OP of a political ad (i.e., a campaign) moderates the comments, it\u2019s problematic: they might remove dissenting perspectives. And if we (the admins) moderate the comments of a political ad, it\u2019s even more problematic, putting us in the position of either moderating too much or too little, with inevitable accusations of bias either way.\n\nThe problem, we realized, is similar to what we see in r/announcements: lots of people commenting on a highly visible post outside the context of a community. It\u2019s fair to say that r/announcements isn\u2019t really a community; it lacks the culture, cohesion, and moderation that benefit most other subreddits, and as a result, the quality of conversation has deteriorated as the audience has grown.\n\nUltimately, conversations really only happen in the context of a community, and neither r/announcements nor political ads with comments on provide this. We believe we can foster better discussion on both with a different approach.\n\n## What we\u2019re testing today\n\nInstead of having the usual free-for-all of comments on the r/announcements post itself, we are trying out a new experience today that encourages discussion of this post within other communities\u2014an approach we hope works for political ads as well.\n\nBelow is a stickied comment with a link to submit this post to other communities on Reddit and a list of those discussion posts. The stickied comment will update automatically with new posts.\n\nA few other details to note for this test:\n\n* **The discussion posts are like any other post**, which means they can be voted on by users and removed by mods.\n* **Communities that don\u2019t want to participate don\u2019t have to.** (If you\u2019re a mod of a community where a user attempts to crosspost this, you will get a Modmail alerting you to this with [opt-out instructions](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/).)\n* **Individual community rules apply to these posts just as any other**, so read the rules before attempting to bring the discussion into a completely unrelated community.\n* **Our stickied comment will link to discussions only from communities subject to our ads allow list.** Communities that have already opted not to appear in r/all won\u2019t appear in the comment either, even if there is a discussion of this post there.\n* **After today\u2019s test, we will likely test this system with political ads.**\n\nThis test will be a success if there are a variety of posts and conversations about this post, even\u2014and perhaps particularly\u2014if they are critical.\n\n## How we\u2019re answering questions\n\nr/announcements posts have an important difference from political ads: I treat them as AMAs and do my best to answer questions and respond to criticism (both of which I appreciate). With this approach, I expect doing so will be more difficult (at least this first time). However, the point of this test is not to make you hunt for our answers or for us to reply to fewer questions, and we don\u2019t intend to use this approach for all our admin posts (e.g., in r/ModNews, r/changelog, r/ModSupport, and others, which are smaller subreddits that still work well).\n\nFor today, we\u2019re going to make the first link of this post to r/ModNews and start by answering mods\u2019 questions there. In a future announcement, we may ask a specific community if they would host us for the discussion that day (depending on what the announcement is) and set that as an official destination for discussion, like a regular AMA.\n\nAdditionally, I\u2019ll do my best to find other places to respond, and we\u2019ll maintain another comment below this post to list replies we\u2019ve given outside of r/announcements so you can easily find our responses (which was a feature request from [our post](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/g3r4xpm/) last week).\n\nUltimately, the goal of this test is to enable Reddit to do what Reddit does best: facilitate conversations (within the context of a community), provide commentary on political ads the way redditors already do on news and politics daily (sharing more information and calling bullshit in the comments when necessary), and extend the discussion well beyond the scope of the original post.\n\nThank you for participating. We hope this approach sets the stage for successful commentary not just today but down the road on political ads as well.\n\nSteve\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Edit (9/28/20):** Update: After initial testing and a few small tweaks to the sorting and score display of the links in stickied comments like the one below, we\u2019ll be using this discussion system on political ads moving forward. \n\nAs I mentioned, our goal with this approach was to encourage these types of discussions to happen within the context of a community. While this feature is completely optional for communities (opt-out instructions [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/ilc4zc/testing_a_new_admin_post_type/)), we were pleased overall with the level of engagement that we saw from communities and users on this test post.\n\nWe\u2019re still exploring how we\u2019ll use this feature for r/announcements posts and how we can work with specific communities to have discussions about them.

                    "selftext": "[A few weeks ago](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/gxas21/upcoming_changes_to_our_content_policy_our_board/), we committed to closing the gap between our values and our policies to explicitly address hate. After talking extensively with mods, outside organizations, and our own teams, we\u2019re updating our content policy today and enforcing it (with your help).\n\n## First, a quick recap\n\nSince our last post, here\u2019s what we\u2019ve been doing:\n\n* **We brought on a** [**new Board member**](https://redditblog.com/2020/06/10/reddit-welcomes-michael-seibel-to-board-of-directors/).\n* **We held policy calls with mods**\u2014both from established Mod Councils and from communities disproportionately targeted with hate\u2014and discussed areas where we can do better to action bad actors, clarify our policies, make mods' lives easier, and concretely reduce hate.\n   * You can find [detailed notes from our All-Council mod call here](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/hi3nkr/the_mod_conversations_that_went_into_todays), including specific product work we discussed.\n* **We developed our enforcement plan**, including both our immediate actions (e.g., today\u2019s bans) and long-term investments (tackling the most critical work discussed in our mod calls, sustainably enforcing the new policies, and advancing Reddit\u2019s community governance).\n\nFrom our conversations with mods and outside experts, it\u2019s clear that while we\u2019ve gotten better in some areas\u2014like actioning violations at the community level, [scaling enforcement efforts](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/hbiuas/reddit_security_report_june_18_2020/), measurably reducing hateful experiences like harassment [year over year](https://www.adl.org/online-hate-2020#results)\u2014we still have a long way to go to address the gaps in our policies and enforcement to date.\n\nThese include addressing questions our policies have left unanswered (like whether hate speech is allowed or even protected on Reddit), aspects of our product and mod tools that are still too easy for individual bad actors to abuse (inboxes, chats, modmail), and areas where we can do better to partner with our mods and communities who want to combat the same hateful conduct we do.\n\nUltimately, it\u2019s our responsibility to support our communities by taking stronger action against those who try to weaponize parts of Reddit against other people. In the near term, this support will translate into some of the product work we discussed with mods. But it starts with dealing squarely with the hate we can mitigate today through our policies and enforcement.\n\n## New Policy\n\nThis is the [new content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy). Here\u2019s what\u2019s different:\n\n* It starts with a statement of our vision for Reddit and our communities, including the basic expectations we have for all communities and users.\n* **Rule 1** explicitly states that communities and users that promote hate based on identity or vulnerability will be banned.\n   * There is an expanded definition of what constitutes a violation of this rule, along with specific examples, in our [Help Center article](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).\n* **Rule 2** ties together our previous rules on prohibited behavior with an ask to abide by community rules and post with authentic, personal interest.\n   * Debate and creativity are welcome, but spam and malicious attempts to interfere with other communities are not.\n* The other rules are the same in spirit but have been rewritten for clarity and inclusiveness.\n\nAlongside the change to the content policy, we are initially banning about 2000 subreddits, the vast majority of which are inactive. Of these communities, about [200](https://www.redditstatic.com/banned-subreddits-june-2020.txt) have more than 10 daily users. Both r/The_Donald and r/ChapoTrapHouse were included.\n\nAll communities on Reddit must abide by our content policy in good faith. We banned r/The_Donald because it has not done so, despite every opportunity. The community has consistently hosted and upvoted more rule-breaking content than average (Rule 1), antagonized us and other communities (Rules 2 and 8), and its mods have refused to meet our most basic expectations. Until now, we\u2019ve worked in good faith to help them preserve the community as a space for its users\u2014through warnings, mod changes, quarantining, and more.\n\nThough smaller, r/ChapoTrapHouse was banned for similar reasons: They consistently host rule-breaking content and their mods have demonstrated no intention of reining in their community.\n\nTo be clear, views across the political spectrum are allowed on Reddit\u2014but all communities must work within our policies and do so in good faith, without exception.\n\n## Our commitment\n\nOur policies will never be perfect, with new edge cases that inevitably lead us to evolve them in the future. And as users, you will always have more context, community vernacular, and cultural values to inform the standards set within your communities than we as site admins or any AI ever could.\n\nBut just as our content moderation cannot scale effectively without your support, you need more support from us as well, and we admit we have fallen short towards this end. We are committed to working with you to combat the bad actors, abusive behaviors, and toxic communities that undermine our mission and get in the way of the creativity, discussions, and communities that bring us all to Reddit in the first place. We hope that our progress towards this commitment, with today\u2019s update and those to come, makes Reddit a place you enjoy and are proud to be a part of for many years to come.\n\nEdit: After digesting feedback, we made a clarifying change to our help center article for [Promoting Hate Based on Identity or Vulnerability](https://www.reddithelp.com/en/categories/rules-reporting/account-and-community-restrictions/promoting-hate-based-identity-or).",

                    "selftext": "**TL;DR: We\u2019re working with mods to change our content policy to explicitly address hate.** u/kn0thing **has resigned from our board to fill his seat with a Black candidate, a request we will honor. I want to take responsibility for the history of our policies over the years that got us here, and we still have work to do.**\n\nAfter watching people across the country mourn and demand an end to centuries of murder and violent discrimination against Black people, I wanted to speak out. I wanted to do this both as a human being, who sees this grief and pain and knows I have been spared from it myself because of the color of my skin, and as someone who literally has a platform and, with it, a duty to speak out.\n\nEarlier this week, I wrote an email to our company addressing this crisis and a few ways Reddit will respond. When we shared it, many of the responses said something like, \u201cHow can a company that has faced racism from users on its own platform over the years credibly take such a position?\u201d\n\nThese questions, which I know are coming from a place of real pain and which I take to heart, are really a statement: There is an unacceptable gap between our beliefs as people and a company, and what you see in our content policy. \n\nOver the last fifteen years, hundreds of millions of people have come to Reddit for things that I believe are fundamentally good: user-driven communities\u2014across a wider spectrum of interests and passions than I could\u2019ve imagined when we first created subreddits\u2014and the kinds of content and conversations that keep people coming back day after day. It's why we come to Reddit as users, as mods, and as employees who want to bring this sort of community and belonging to the world and make it better daily.\n\nHowever, as Reddit has grown, alongside much good, it is facing its own challenges around hate and racism. We have to acknowledge and accept responsibility for the role we have played. Here are three problems we are most focused on:\n\n* Parts of Reddit reflect an unflattering but real resemblance to the world in the hate that Black users and communities see daily, despite the progress we have made in improving our tooling and enforcement. \n* Users and moderators genuinely do not have enough clarity as to where we as administrators stand on racism. \n* Our moderators are frustrated and need a real seat at the table to help shape the policies that they help us enforce.\n\nWe are already working to fix these problems, and this is a promise for more urgency. Our current [content policy](https://www.redditinc.com/policies/content-policy) is effectively nine rules for what you cannot do on Reddit. In many respects, it\u2019s served us well. Under it, we have made meaningful progress cleaning up the platform (and done so without undermining the free expression and authenticity that fuels Reddit). That said, we still have work to do. This current policy lists only what you cannot do, articulates none of the values behind the rules, and does not explicitly take a stance on hate or racism.\n\nWe will update our content policy to include a vision for Reddit and its communities to aspire to, a statement on hate, the context for the rules, and a principle that Reddit isn\u2019t to be used as a weapon. We have details to work through, and while we will move quickly, I do want to be thoughtful and also gather feedback from our moderators (through our Mod Councils). With more moderator engagement, the timeline is weeks, not months.\n\nAnd just this morning, Alexis Ohanian (u/kn0thing), my Reddit cofounder, announced that he is resigning from our board and that he wishes for his seat to be filled with a Black candidate, a request that the board and I will honor. We thank Alexis for this meaningful gesture and all that he\u2019s done for us over the years.\n\nAt the risk of making this unreadably long, I'd like to take this moment to share how we got here in the first place, where we have made progress, and where, despite our best intentions, we have fallen short.\n\nIn the early days of Reddit, 2005\u20132006, our idealistic \u201cpolicy\u201d was that, excluding spam, we would not remove content. We were small and did not face many hard decisions. When this ideal was tested, we [banned racist users](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/6m87a/can_we_ban_this_extremely_racist_asshole/c0497kd/?context=3) anyway. In the end, we acted based on our beliefs, despite our \u201cpolicy.\u201d \n\nI left Reddit from 2010\u20132015. During this time, in addition to rapid user growth, Reddit\u2019s no-removal policy [ossified](https://redditblog.com/2014/09/06/every-man-is-responsible-for-his-own-soul/) and its content policy took [no position on hate](https://web.archive.org/web/20150710230652/https://www.reddit.com/rules/). \n\nWhen I returned in 2015, my top priority was creating a content policy to do two things: deal with hateful communities I had been immediately confronted with (like r/CoonTown, which was explicitly designed to spread racist hate) and provide a clear policy of what\u2019s acceptable on Reddit and what\u2019s not. [We banned that community and others](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/) because they were \u201cmaking Reddit worse\u201d but were not clear and direct about their role in sowing hate. We crafted our [2015 policy](https://web.archive.org/web/20150806171017/https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) around behaviors adjacent to hate that were actionable and objective: violence and harassment, because we struggled to create a definition of hate and racism that we could defend and enforce at our scale. Through continual updates to these policies [2017](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/78p7bz/update_on_sitewide_rules_regarding_violent_content/), [2018](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/863xcj/new_addition_to_sitewide_rules_regarding_the_use/), [2019](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/dbf9nj/changes_to_our_policy_against_bullying_and/), [2020](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditsecurity/comments/emd7yx/updates_to_our_policy_around_impersonation/) (and a broader definition of violence), we have removed thousands of hateful communities. \n\nWhile we dealt with many communities themselves, we still did not provide the clarity\u2014and it showed, both in our enforcement and in confusion about where we stand. In 2018, I confusingly said [racism is not against the rules, but also isn\u2019t welcome on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/3fx2au/content_policy_update/ctsqobs/). This gap between our content policy and our values has eroded our effectiveness in combating hate and racism on Reddit; I accept full responsibility for this.\n\nThis inconsistency has hurt our trust with our users and moderators and has made us slow to respond to problems. This was also true with r/the_donald, a community that relished in exploiting and detracting from the best of Reddit and that is now nearly disintegrated on their own accord. As we looked to our policies, \u201cBreaking Reddit\u201d was not a sufficient explanation for actioning a political subreddit, and I fear we let being technically correct get in the way of doing the right thing. Clearly, we should have quarantined it sooner.\n\nThe majority of our top communities have a rule banning hate and racism, which makes us proud, and is evidence why a [community-led approach is the only way to scale moderation online](https://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF16/20191016/110075/HHRG-116-IF16-Wstate-HuffmanS-20191016.pdf). That said, this is not a rule communities should have to write for themselves and we need to rebalance the burden of enforcement. I also accept responsibility for this. \n\nDespite making significant progress over the years, we have to turn a mirror on ourselves and be willing to do the hard work of making sure we are living up to our values in our product and policies. This is a significant moment. We have a choice: return to the status quo or use this opportunity for change. We at Reddit are opting for the latter, and we will do our very best to be a part of the progress.\n\nI will be sticking around for a while to answer questions as usual, but I also know that our policies and actions will speak louder than our comments.\n\nThanks,\n\nSteve",

While the fight to preserve net neutrality is going to be longer than we had hoped, this is far from over.\n\nMany of you have asked what comes next. We don\u2019t exactly know yet, but it seems likely that the FCC\u2019s decision will be challenged in court soon, and we would be supportive of that challenge. It\u2019s also possible that Congress can decide to take up the cause and create strong, enforceable net neutrality rules that aren\u2019t subject to the political winds at the FCC. Nevertheless, this will be a complex process that takes time.\n\nWhat is certain is that Reddit will continue to be involved in this issue in the way that we know best: seeking out every opportunity to amplify your voices and share them with those who have the power to make a difference. \n\nThis isn\u2019t the outcome we wanted, but you should all be proud of the awareness you\u2019ve created.

                    "selftext": "**Update**: Thank you, everyone! We were in touch with Congressman Mike Doyle's office yesterday sharing some of your great stories from his home district in Pennsylvania (thanks, u/Bones_MD!), and they've heard you loud and clear. They are leading an effort to get Congress to ask the FCC to delay their December 14 vote, but they need as many Congressional members as possible to sign on. You can help them by calling or writing your member of Congress (look them up [here](https://www.house.gov/htbin/findrep) or through [www.battleforthenet.com](https://www.battleforthenet.com/)) and specifically asking him or her to sign onto Representative Doyle's letter to the FCC. We'll be doing the same. Keep it up, we're being heard!\n\n*****\n\nHi All,\n\nIf you spent any time on Reddit last week, you [may have noticed a common theme](https://i.redditmedia.com/IhvWlif94HFLCRp0uNqDNjOEsSn2IdI6NVm-OaNnYvM.png?s=2fe8fbb8cd76df11a24f8a105e8a8fae) in the posts on your front page, so we wanted to take a moment to recap what\u2019s happened so far in the fight for net neutrality, underscore how important this issue is to Reddit, and share how we plan to continue to stand up for an internet that remains open and free.\n\nOn Tuesday, FCC chairman Ajit Pai [announced his intention to vote on a full rollback of the 2015 net neutrality rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/7ej943/fcc_announces_plan_to_repeal_net_neutrality/). While the pre-Thanksgiving timing of the announcement might have helped the news sneak by over the holidays, you all have helped prevent that from happening. Aside from ensuring that net neutrality was discussed IRL around Thanksgiving tables across the country, you brought the conversation about the open internet to almost every community on the site, from r/dataisbeautiful to r/trashpandas. You\u2019ve made [high-quality gifs](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/7eklnu/when_i_hear_net_neutrality_is_under_fire_again/), flooded [the meme market](https://www.reddit.com/r/MemeEconomy/comments/7eqxtf/ea_memes_and_fcc_memes_have_a_quick_return_of/), explained the issue to people who are [out of the loop](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/7elxew/whats_going_on_with_net_neutrality_ask_all_your/), and [given a history](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/7elqw7/redditor_lists_all_the_times_ipss_have_illegally/) of why net neutrality rules are essential. \n\nIn just one week, you made 50,000 unique posts and over 350,000 comments related to net neutrality, generating over 21 million votes. While Tuesday\u2019s news hits close to home, we are grateful that the Reddit community cares just as much about net neutrality as we do at Reddit HQ.\n\nAs many of you know, the FCC\u2019s vote will happen on December 14 and is expected to pass. However, the vote is also expected to be challenged almost immediately in court, likely kicking off a long process that will take years to work through. During this time, Congress will likely try to legislate a fix. As a still-small company that owes its existence to net neutrality\u2019s giving us a fair chance in the marketplace, we will take every opportunity to share our perspective and give constructive input to this process. The [data says](https://www.scribd.com/document/353285485/Freedman-Consulting-Net-Neutrality-Poll) that Americans don\u2019t see this as a partisan issue, and neither do we.\n\nMost of the activism right now is focused on driving messages to Congress and the FCC before December 14 \\(including a protest in DC the day before the vote\\).  The FCC has received a record 22 million comments on net neutrality but has indicated they have not reviewed comments that don\u2019t introduce new facts into the record or make serious legal arguments. Additionally, they believe a number of the comments are fake. While we are unlikely to change the FCC\u2019s decision, we encourage you to follow [Commissioner Rosenworcel\u2019s suggestion](http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rosenworcel-fcc-net-neutrality-repeal-20171122-story.html) and continue to \u201cmake a ruckus\u201d to let the FCC hear your individual stories on the importance of net neutrality.  \n\nA few months ago, u/kn0thing [asked you to leave comments explaining why net neutrality is important to you](https://www.reddit.com/r/blog/comments/6mtgtp/we_need_your_voice_as_we_continue_the_fight_for/), and thousands of you delivered. Today, we\u2019re asking you again to leave personal stories that we can use in the battle ahead. When we shared these stories with members of Congress this past July, we saw firsthand how effective they are at humanizing an issue that is too often perceived as an abstract battle between big corporate interests. \n\nWe will continue to share these personal testimonials with more members of Congress, with the media, and potentially file them in court briefs. Our goal in this effort is to keep the personal dimension of the open internet top of mind for everyone who wants to repeal net neutrality. We know how powerful redditors banding together for a common cause can be, so our focus will continue to be on amplifying *your* voices, from Capitol Hill to \u2014 if it comes to it \u2014 the Supreme Court. \n\nSo, please tell us in the comments:\n\n*How would your life change if internet service providers started blocking or throttling certain internet traffic, or creating paid prioritization channels for certain content?* \n\nInclude as much detail as you feel comfortable sharing. Generally, the more specific, the better. Mentioning your state and Congressional representative is especially useful.\n\nThank you.\n\nu/ArabScarab \\(Jessica Ashooh, our Head of Policy\\), and I will hang around to answer questions.",

We are taking a more aggressive stance against toxic users and poorly behaving communities. You can filter r/all now.\n\nHi All,\n\nI am sorry: I am sorry for compromising the trust you all have in Reddit, and I am sorry to those that I created work and stress for, particularly over the holidays. It is heartbreaking to think that my actions distracted people from their family over the holiday; instigated harassment of our moderators; and may have harmed Reddit itself, which I love more than just about anything.\n\nThe United States is more divided than ever, and we see that tension within Reddit itself. The community that was formed in support of President-elect Donald Trump organized and grew rapidly, but within it were users that devoted themselves to antagonising the broader Reddit community.\n\nMany of you are aware of my attempt to [troll the trolls](https://www.reddit.com/r/HighQualityGifs/comments/5eo8rq/the_donald_gets_infiltrated_by_reddits_ceo/?st=IVWNCVHU&sh=a9c7a036) last week. I honestly thought I might find some common ground with that community by meeting them on their level. It did not go as planned. I restored the original comments after less than an hour, and [explained what I did](https://www.reddit.com/r/The_Donald/comments/5ekdy9/the_admins_are_suffering_from_low_energy_have/dad5sf1/).\n\nI spent my formative years as a young troll on the Internet. I also led the team that built Reddit ten years ago, and spent years moderating the original Reddit communities, so I am as comfortable online as anyone. As CEO, I am often out in the world speaking about how Reddit is the home to conversation online, and a follow on question about harassment on our site is always asked. We have dedicated many of our resources to fighting harassment on Reddit, which is why letting one of our most engaged communities openly harass me felt hypocritical.\n\nWhile many users across the site found what I did funny, or appreciated that I was standing up to the bullies (I received plenty of support from users of r/the_donald), many others did not. I understand what I did has greater implications than my relationship with one community, and it is fair to raise the question of whether this erodes trust in Reddit. I hope our transparency around this event is an indication that we take matters of trust seriously. Reddit is no longer the little website my college roommate, u/kn0thing, and I started more than eleven years ago. It is a massive collection of communities that provides news, entertainment, and fulfillment for millions of people around the world, and I am continually humbled by what Reddit has grown into. I will never risk your trust like this again, and we are updating our internal controls to prevent this sort of thing from happening in the future.\n\nMore than anything, I want Reddit to heal, and I want our country to heal, and although many of you have asked us to ban the r/the_donald outright, it is with this spirit of healing that I have resisted doing so. If there is anything about this election that we have learned, it is that there are communities that feel alienated and just want to be heard, and Reddit has always been a place where those voices can be heard.\n\nHowever, when we separate the behavior of some of r/the_donald users from their politics, it is their behavior we cannot tolerate. The opening statement of our [Content Policy](https://www.reddit.com/help/contentpolicy) asks that we all show enough respect to others so that we all may continue to enjoy Reddit for what it is. It is my first duty to do what is best for Reddit, and the current situation is not sustainable.\n\nHistorically, we have relied on our relationship with moderators to curb bad behaviors. While some of the moderators have been helpful, this has not been wholly effective, and we are now taking a more proactive approach to policing behavior that is detrimental to Reddit:\n\n* We have identified hundreds of the most toxic users and are taking action against them, ranging from warnings to timeouts to permanent bans.\nPosts stickied on r/the_donald will no longer appear in r/all. r/all is not our frontpage, but is a popular listing that our most engaged users frequent, including myself. The sticky feature was designed for moderators to make announcements or highlight specific posts. It was not meant to circumvent organic voting, which r/the_donald does to slingshot posts into r/all, often in a manner that is antagonistic to the rest of the community.\n\n* We will continue taking on the most troublesome users, and going forward, if we do not see the situation improve, we will continue to take privileges from communities whose users continually cross the line\u2014up to an outright ban.\n\nAgain, I am sorry for the trouble I have caused. While I intended no harm, that was not the result, and I hope these changes improve your experience on Reddit.\n\nSteve\n\nPS: As a bonus, I have enabled filtering for r/all for all users. You can modify the filters by [visiting r/all on the desktop web](https://g.redditmedia.com/34sCU-v1SO7xXrFliAOHfMR2bVjuoC2xYPV3OnH6C9Y.gif?w=1024&fm=mp4&mp4-fragmented=false&s=c4127836f34b00ac6a66b1b429e02440) (I\u2019m old, sorry), but it will affect all platforms, including our native apps on iOS and Android.\n",
